# Games Played Fix - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### ✅ Fixed Issue #2: Accurate Games Played Count

**Problem**: Script was using arbitrary default of 3 games when API didn't provide games count
```javascript
// BEFORE:
games: player.games || 3  // ❌ Arbitrary!
```

**Solution**: Use team's total games (wins + losses) from already-fetched team records
```javascript
// AFTER:
let gamesPlayed = null;

if (player.games && player.games > 0) {
  gamesPlayed = player.games;  // Prefer API data if available
} else if (teamGamesMap[team] && teamGamesMap[team] > 0) {
  gamesPlayed = teamGamesMap[team];  // Use team games as fallback
}
// null if neither available (gracefully handled in display)
```

## Code Changes in `generate-player-leaders.mjs`

### 1. **Updated `processPlayerStats()` function** (Lines 238-281)
- Added `teamRecords` parameter
- Creates team games lookup map from team records
- Uses team's total games (wins + losses) as fallback
- Added comprehensive documentation explaining methodology

### 2. **Updated `filterPower5Players()` function** (Lines 73-93)
- Changed from `async` to synchronous function
- Added `teamRecords` parameter
- Removed duplicate API call for team records
- Now reuses records passed from main()

### 3. **Fixed per-game calculation rounding** (Line 349)
- Changed `Math.ceil()` to `Math.round()` for more accurate rounding
- Example: 1,000 yards ÷ 3 games = 333.33 → now shows 333/G (not 334/G)

### 4. **Added graceful null handling** (Lines 348-354)
- Only shows per-game stats if games count is available
- Falls back to showing only totals if games is null
- Prevents showing misleading `/G` stats with bad data

### 5. **Optimized main() function** (Lines 677-684)
- Moved team records fetch earlier in execution
- Passes records to both `filterPower5Players()` and `processPlayerStats()`
- Eliminates duplicate API call (previously fetched records twice)

## Benefits

✅ **More Accurate**: Uses actual team games instead of arbitrary default  
✅ **Efficient**: Eliminated duplicate API call for team records  
✅ **Robust**: Gracefully handles missing data  
✅ **Better Rounding**: Math.round() instead of Math.ceil()  
✅ **Documented**: Clear comments explaining methodology  
✅ **No Breaking Changes**: Still works if API provides games field

## Games Played Methodology

The script now uses this hierarchy for determining games played:

1. **API-provided games** (if exists and > 0)
   - Most accurate - actual player participation
   - Used when available

2. **Team total games** (wins + losses)
   - Second best - official team record
   - Reasonable proxy for player participation
   - Already fetched for conference filtering

3. **null** (if neither available)
   - Gracefully handled in display
   - Shows only total stats (no `/G`)
   - Better than showing misleading data

---

## Testing Checklist

After implementation, verify:
- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] Players show per-game stats based on team games
- [ ] Per-game calculations use Math.round() not Math.ceil()
- [ ] Players with null games show only totals
- [ ] Console shows "Built games map for X teams"
- [ ] No duplicate API calls for team records
- [ ] Power 5 filtering still works correctly

## Examples

**Before**:
```
Player: John Doe
Games: 3 (arbitrary default)
1,000 yards ÷ 3 = 334 YPG (Math.ceil)
```

**After**:
```
Player: John Doe  
Games: 8 (from team record: 6 wins + 2 losses)
1,000 yards ÷ 8 = 125 YPG (Math.round)
```

---

## Performance Impact

**Positive**:
- Eliminated 1 duplicate API call to `/records` endpoint
- Faster execution (one less network request)

**Neutral**:
- Same number of total API calls
- Team records already being fetched for filtering

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for later:
1. Add player game logs API call for 100% accurate individual games (if available)
2. Show warning icon if using team games vs API-provided games
3. Add statistics on data sources (e.g., "8/10 players using team games")
4. Cache team records between stat categories to reduce API calls further
