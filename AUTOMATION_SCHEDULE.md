## Manual-Only Workflows

The following workflows are **manual-only** (no automation schedule):

- **`clear-old-content.yml`** - Clears all content (emergency use)
- **`debug-api.yml`** - Debug API responses
- **`generate-cfb.yml`** - Generates all content types at once

## Note on Workflow Triggers

All automated workflows above also include manual override capability (`workflow_dispatch`), meaning you can trigger them manually from the GitHub Actions tab if needed, even though they run automatically on their schedules.

## Time Zone Notes

- **CST (Central Standard Time)**: UTC-6
- **CDT (Central Daylight Time)**: UTC-5
- All schedules include fallback times for both CST and CDT to handle daylight saving transitions
- GitHub Actions uses UTC internally, but schedules are displayed in CST for clarity

## Concurrency Control

All automated workflows include concurrency controls to prevent overlapping runs and ensure data integrity.
